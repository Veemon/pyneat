# pyneat
This is a python implementation of the original NEAT algorithm, formally known as
Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies. Although the library was created for use in
experimentation with the game of snake, https://github.com/Veemon/deep-snake, it is a 
fully functional - user focused library.
  
  
To get an idea of what I mean by user focused, refer to the example code:
*examples/input_detector.py*
